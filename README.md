# Property-Routing-does-not-exist-on-type-typeof-import
I new to leaftlet, I believe I've added everything needed to use the Leaflet Routing Machine API but clearly I'm missing something because I get a error on Leaflet.Routing.control.  Property 'Routing' does not exist on type 'typeof import("node_modules/@types/leaflet/index")'. Thank you in advance for your help


I did added these refs and scripts as the documents said: 

import L from 'leaflet';

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.2.0/dist/leaflet.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet-routing-machine@latest/dist/leaflet-routing-machine.css" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.2.0/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet-routing-machine@latest/dist/leaflet-routing-machine.js"></script>
