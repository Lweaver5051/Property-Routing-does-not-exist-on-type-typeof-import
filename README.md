# Property-Routing-does-not-exist-on-type-typeof-import
I new to leaftlet, I believe I've added everything needed to use the Leaflet Routing Machine API but clearly I'm missing something because I get a error on Leaflet.Routing.control.  Property 'Routing' does not exist on type 'typeof import("node_modules/@types/leaflet/index")'. Thank you in advance for your help
